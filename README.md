# library-fine-record
A library charges a fine for every book returned late. For first 7 days the fine is 10 PKR, for 8-14 days fine is 20PKR and above 14 days fine is 50PKR. If you return the book after 31 days your membership will be cancelled. Write a program to accept the number of days the member is late to return the book and display the fine or the appropriate message.
