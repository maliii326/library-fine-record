# library-fine-record
A library charges a fine for every book returned late. For first 7 days the fine is 10 PKR, for 8-14 days fine is 20PKR and above 14 days fine is 50PKR. If you return the book after 31 days your membership will be cancelled. Write a program to accept the number of days the member is late to return the book and display the fine or the appropriate message.
print('enter total days')
days=int(input())
if days<=5:
    print('fine is zero')
    print('you are on time ')
elif days>=5 and days<=7 :
    print('fine is 10PKR')
    print('you are',7-days,' days late')
elif days>=8 and days<=14 :
    print('fine is20pkr')
    print('you are',14-days,' days late')
elif days>=31:
    print('membership cancel')
